Data Visualization Tests
------------------------

The basic goal is to use an SVG element to display individual data sets.  The shade of each sub-element is determined
by the strength of the data.

The next steps planned are:

1. Animate the shading as the data sets change
2. Interactivity by identifying clicked sub-elements
3. Display zoomed-in views of sub-elementson selection
